(Better to do in htaccess than with a filter. Blocks the function completely prevents loading instead of blocking afterwise.)

# Options
../wp-admin/options.php

Writing
	Disable discussions & comments
	Disable email notifications "Email me whenever"
	Avatars off

Media
	Organize my uploads = prettier image urls

Permalinks
	Post name or custom /%category%/%postname% <- category adds possible SEO scoring
	Keep in mind a trailing slash on the URL will get rid of all URL parameters
	Custom post type requires the permalink page to be saved again to reroute URLs again
